For this project I did a simple one page website for a product called Fengr, handmade chai syrup.
I utilized the nesting ability of SASS and made some variables to use in my code. The variables then went into seperate files and folder and then I used forward to simplify the code in my main.scss. I also used mixin for styling my headings.
